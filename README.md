# Continual Learning with Echo State Networks
Experiments for ESANN 2021

To reproduce experiments: `python launch_experiment.py --config_file CONFIGS/path/to/file.yaml`.  
If you do not want to use `ray` to run your experiments (`pip install ray`) you can set the `no_ray` flag to `true` in the configuration file.
